clear the localstorage for site-specific items and test the app when there is no auth user
try testing the app on multiple tabs by setting different states to persist
if the result is not great, just switch to sessionstorage and test
custom mouse is still calculating on app page . fix iT
add a custom 404
create the alert modals
login as another user and test all the features

remove all the array.from calls where unnecesary

// advanced
what if the user has 5000 repositories? localStorage explodes lol. fix this issue
what if a repositories also has 20k commits, persisting all commits won't be ideal.
you might check these cases adopt memory management


//immediate (for MVP)
write a detailed readme file
add a link to the logo image for users to navigate to the home page
disable the sign-up button
use default placeholder images for commit contributors
make sure the repo (on the graph page) description is dynamic

[not urgent] add a welcome modal when a user visits the app page for the first
and is signed in
graph still not including today's commit count in recent repos (or allrepos) fix it

[urgent] when different user logs in on different tabs,
their data leaks to the other tabs making the data for newly
authed users to be used for all tabs (due to the behaviour)
of localstorage. fix it
